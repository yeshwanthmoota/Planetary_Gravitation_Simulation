Some Facts of this project:
    1. Real original values of Gravitational Constant is not used
    2. When the planets collide they perform a elastic collision
    3. Real concept of Gravitational acceleration is used
    4. Every Planet has it's own gravity which effects all other planets and they move accordingly almost same as what happens in real life

A first planet is initialized of (type 5) in the center of the screen Let's name this planet X


Instructions: 
    To place a planet just click the mouse where you want to place it
    Options:
    press -> (1-9)
    ### As we know mass is proportional to R^3
    ### since we knoe "mass = density * 4/3 * pi * R^3" (density * volume)
    1 - planet of radius 20 assume mass = 1 (type 1)
    2 - planet of radius 40 => mass = 8 (type 2)
    3 - planet of radius 60 => mass = 27 (type 3)
    4 - planet of radius 80 => mass = 64 (type 4)
    5 - planet of radius 100 => mass = 125 (type 5)

    6 - Launch a planet of (type 1) with orbital velocity w.r.t the first planet i.e. planet X
    7 - Launch a planet of (type 1) with escape velocity w.r.t the first planet i.e. planet X
    8 - Launch a planet with a random speed b/w orbital and escape velocity in a random direction
    9 - Launch a planet towards planet X's center with ridiculous speed
